## Brainstorming

When the user says "let's brainstorm on X", "brainstorm X", or similar, immediately
create `sandbox/brainstorm-{subject}.md` before the discussion begins. Write design
decisions to that file in real time as the discussion unfolds — do not discuss first
and reconstruct afterward. The file is the record; chat is ephemeral.

## Task Management

All work in this repository is tracked through a structured task management
system. Before starting any work, check the task system to understand current
priorities and status.

**Full documentation:** [`project/tasks/README.md`](project/tasks/README.md)

### Task Types

There are three task types. Every task README has a `Task-type` field.

**USER-TASK** — top-level, human/Oracle-owned. All top-level work must be a
user-task. No Parent field, no pipeline sections. Created with `new-user-task.sh`.

**USER-SUBTASK** — human/Oracle-owned subtask. Planning steps, reviews,
approvals, research. Does not go to the pipeline. Can contain further
user-subtasks or pipeline-subtasks. Created with `new-user-subtask.sh`.

**PIPELINE-SUBTASK** — the pipeline's unit of work. A `build-N` entry point
authored by the Oracle and submitted to the orchestrator, or a pipeline-internal
node (component, integrate, test) created by the TM. Pipeline-owned once
submitted. Can only contain pipeline-subtasks. Created with `new-pipeline-subtask.sh`.

**Hierarchy rules:**
- All top-level work must be a user-task
- user-task → user-subtasks and/or pipeline-subtasks
- user-subtask → user-subtasks and/or pipeline-subtasks
- pipeline-subtask → pipeline-subtasks only
- No human-owned node may appear under a pipeline-owned node

**Naming convention:**
- Top-level tasks: `{6-char-hex-id}-{name}` (e.g. `a3f2c1-my-task`)
- Subtasks: `{parent-short-id}-{NNNN}-{name}` (e.g. `a3f2c1-0001-design-review`)

The `NNNN` four-digit number **defines the implementation order** of subtasks within
a parent task. Subtasks must be worked in ascending `NNNN` order unless explicitly
noted otherwise. The number is assigned at creation time by `Next-subtask-id` in
the parent's metadata and incremented automatically by the creation scripts.

If the intended implementation order changes after creation, use
`project/tasks/scripts/reorder-subtasks.py` to renumber the directories to match
the new order. Never implement subtasks out of their numbered sequence without
first reordering them — the numbers are the contract.

When a subtask is completed, its directory is renamed with an `X-` prefix
(e.g. `X-a3f2c1-0001-design-review`). The `X-` prefix marks the subtask as done
and preserves its number for audit purposes. Completed subtasks are shown with
`[x]` in the parent README's subtask list.

**Domain ownership:**
- **Frontend AI** (Oracle/human assistant): creates user-tasks, user-subtasks,
  and `build-N` pipeline-subtasks. Does NOT edit pipeline-internal subtasks
  once a build is submitted.
- **Orchestrator / TM**: operates on pipeline-subtasks and their internal
  children. Fills in Components, Design, AC. Creates component subtasks.
  Does NOT touch user-task or user-subtask READMEs.

### Workflow Rules

**Before beginning any task or subtask:** describe its purpose and list all
subtasks in order. If the task manager is human, wait for their approval
before starting any implementation work.

**When picking up work:** pull from `backlog/` in top-to-bottom order.
**When starting a task:** move it to `in-progress/` using `move-task.sh`.
**When done:** run `complete-task.sh` — no `--parent` for top-level tasks,
add `--parent` for subtasks.

> **Rule:** Always use the scripts to manage tasks. Never manually edit task
> `README.md` files to add or remove subtasks, and never manually move task
> directories between status folders.

> **Rule:** Never create task directories or write task README files directly
> using shell commands (`cat`, `mkdir`, heredocs, etc.). Always use the
> provided scripts. Use `Edit` or `Write` only to fill in content sections
> (Goal, Context, Notes) after a script has created the file.

> **Rule:** When a subtask is finished, always run `complete-task.sh --parent`
> to mark it `[x]` before moving on to the next subtask.

> **Rule:** Subtask `Status` is binary — only `—` (not done) or `complete`
> (done). Subtasks do not have statuses like `draft`, `backlog`, or
> `in-progress`; those apply only to top-level tasks.
